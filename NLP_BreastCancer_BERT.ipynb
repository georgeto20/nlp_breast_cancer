In the STAT gene region, the rare haplotype CAGCC containing the variant alleles of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with an increased risk odds ratio (OR = 5.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51-26.28).   \n","1543                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Among women with breast cancer, with or without BRCA germline mutations, 196 and 198 basepair alleles were present in 4.7% (25/536 alleles), compared with 9% (26/288) controls (P = 0.02).

The risk of disease seems to be increased additively for patients harbouring also the CDKN2A common variant A148T.   \n","795                                                                 We examined polymorphisms in ERCC1 (3'-untranslated region 8092C/A), XPA (5'-untranslated region -4G/A), XPD (Asp(312)Asn in exon 10), XPF (Arg(415)Gln in exon 8), and XPG (Asp(1104)His in exon 15) in 1,053 breast cancer cases and 1,102 population-based controls. The presence of at least one variant allele in XPD was associated with a 25% increase in the odds ratio [OR, 1.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.04-1.50] for breast cancer... We found no association between XPA, XPF, and XPG genotypes, PAH-DNA adducts, and breast cancer risk.   \n","8310                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Polymorphism of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) has been a focus of some recent studies, due to a probable association with breast cancer risk and tumor aggressiveness.   \n","239                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      One of the haplotypes (TGTA - coined haplotype 3) was present in 7.3% (19/260 haplotypes) of controls (n=130) and in 16.8% (40/238 haplotypes) of high-risk breast cancer patients (n=119, P=0.001).
