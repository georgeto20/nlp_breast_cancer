This repo contains Python notebooks with the code for June Liu’s Science Research project “Natural Language Processing Methods for Predicting Gene Association to Breast Cancer Based on Research Abstract Texts”.
The EDA notebook shows the initial Exploratory Data Analysis used to devise the hypothesis.
The Preprocessing notebook shows the text preprocessing steps which are applied to the data for the Logistic Regression and XGBoost models.
Each of the remaining notebooks corresponds to one of the machine learning models developed as part of this project, as well as evaluation of their results based on the hypothesis.
